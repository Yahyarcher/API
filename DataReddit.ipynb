      "from 0-5%, I doubt the water is at 0 F. I'm guessing it's either lack of data or the tap didn't release yet. but water would be at room temp (or pipe temp in this case) before release\n",

The shower handles where I live are just like sink handle: 2 Dimensional. Vertical motion being the pressure (up for more pressure), and horizontal motion being the temperature (left for hotter).\n",
      "Awesome work! Too bad you didn't use Celsius or Kelvin...\n",
      "So really you only have 3 real definitive temperature settings.. geez\n",
      "So I'm assuming the flat bits are there to make it easier to land on a temperature your average person is comfortable with? Not American so I don't know what the temps actually mean, but that seems logical to me.\n",
      "I'd assume from this that part of the reason for it not being incremental is due to the hot water pressure. If your shower is just run off regular hot and cold to a mixer and not an electric one then this is probably easier observed. We used to have a shower that would act like this until we upgraded our boiler and water tanks. Now as the hot water can get to you a lot quicker at any tap around the house, it means the mixer in the shower is a lot more linear.\n",

I’m sure my shower has a similar spread to this because I’ll keep turning the knob down and get slight temperature variance, then with an equal twist to my other slight turns get this steep drop in temperature.\n",

      "Also, it's hilarious seeing the armchair scientists critiquing a guy testing his shower position and graphing it with excel, as if it was super essential to guarantee the experimental integrity of this. Fucking reddit...\n",
      "So your water is -17 C when you don't heat it?\n",

      "Working on a river boat I wish I could get consistent water temps like this graft shows. Being our water tank is in direct contact with the outer hull of the boat the water temp around the boat plays with our cold water temp. Say we are in the Mississippi River my handle would be in the 80% range and give me 50% range temp being my cold water is at a very low temp say 40° Fahrenheit. But let my boat work it’s way thru the ICWW near Texas, where the water doesn’t move much and much more shallow. My handle would be at the 30% mark but giving me a 60-70% mark temp. My cold water temp is closer to 90° Fahrenheit in the ICWW. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also I just recently learned that if you take off the handle of your shower there is a adjustment in there that lets you change the hot/cold water mix. This changed the world for me as we just went thru a remodel and we couldn’t get warm showers while in the river, but only in the ICWW.\n",
      "Unless it's actually coming out ice cold between 0% and 10% handle turn you should just not plot those points at all.\n",

      "In my student accommodation the shower that I use is so far away from the central boiler, that it takes ~20 seconds until the water starts getting warm, even if I turn it to max temp. So turn it to max temp and wait until its warm enough to step into the shower. The temperature keeps rising, so I have to slightly adjust the handle every 5-10 seconds or so. By the time I am done showering I can almost completely turn it to the cold setting and still receive warm water.\n",
      "Yeah. The first changing is the most hardcore\n",
